STEP 1: Create Abstract Clusters (Existing VerveStacks Logic)
├── Demand Clusters (cities/population)
├── Generation Clusters (power plants) 
└── Renewable Clusters (solar+wind zones)

STEP 2: Map Real Infrastructure to Clusters (NEW)
├── Assign substations → clusters (spatial mapping)
├── Aggregate substation data within clusters
└── Create cluster-level "synthetic buses"

STEP 3: Calculate Inter-Cluster NTC (ENHANCED)
├── Find transmission lines crossing cluster boundaries
├── Aggregate line capacities between cluster pairs
└── Calculate realistic NTC between synthetic buses

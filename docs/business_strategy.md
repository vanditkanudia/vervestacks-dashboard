# VerveStacks: The "Open USE" Revolution in Energy Modeling

## Vision Statement
**Pioneer the "Open USE" movement - moving beyond Open SOURCE to Open USABILITY. Transform energy modeling from an elite technical craft requiring PhD-level skills to an accessible analytical tool that any policy researcher can use immediately.**

## The Open USE Paradigm

### Traditional "Open SOURCE" Problem
```
Current Open Source Energy Models:
├── PyPSA: Great code, but 3+ months to get running
├── OSeMOSYS: Open source, but requires extensive training  
├── SWITCH: Available code, but complex data preparation
├── Calliope: Good framework, but manual model building
└── Result: 80% time on setup, 20% on insights
```

### VerveStacks "Open USE" Solution
```
Open USE Energy Models:
├── 🚀 6-minute deployment (vs 6-month setup)
├── 🎯 Policy analyst skills (vs PhD requirements)  
├── 📊 Pre-integrated global datasets (vs manual gathering)
├── 🔧 Auto-calibrated models (vs build-from-scratch)
├── 💡 Immediate scenario analysis (vs months of prep)
└── Result: 5% setup, 95% insights and policy analysis
```

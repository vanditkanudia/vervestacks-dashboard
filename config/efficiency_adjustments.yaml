# VerveStacks Efficiency Adjustment Factors by Country
# 
# Purpose: Country-specific efficiency calibration factors for coal and gas plants
# Usage: Applied as multipliers to base efficiency values during processing
# 
# Format:
#   ISO_CODE:
#     coal_factor: multiplier for coal plant efficiency (default: 1.0)
#     gas_factor: multiplier for gas plant efficiency (default: 1.0)
#     notes: optional calibration notes or reasoning
#
# Example: If base coal efficiency is 35% and coal_factor is 0.9, 
#          final efficiency becomes 31.5% (35% × 0.9)

# Default values (applied when country not specified)
default:
  coal_factor: 1.0
  gas_factor: 1.0
  notes: "Default efficiency - no adjustment"

# Country-specific adjustments
GRC:
  coal_factor: 0.8  # Reduce coal efficiency by 22%
  gas_factor: 0.8   # Reduce gas efficiency by 22%
  notes: "Initial calibration based on GRC analysis - efficiency needs downgrading"

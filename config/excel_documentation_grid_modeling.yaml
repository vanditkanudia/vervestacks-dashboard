      METHODOLOGY: Hourly renewable energy capacity factors converted to normalized fractions for time-slice modeling. 
      Wind speeds extrapolated from 10m to 91.5m hub height using power law (α=0.143), then applied to Vestas V117-3.3MW 
      power curve (3-25 m/s operating range). Solar processing uses PVGIS-calculated power output for fixed-tilt PV systems 
      optimized per location. Both wind and solar capacity factors normalized so hourly fractions sum to 1.0 annually 
      per spatial unit, enabling direct time-slice aggregation in VEDA/TIMES models. Grid modeling ON produces individual 
      profiles per 50×50km renewable energy zone (grid_cell). Grid modeling OFF aggregates to single country-level profile. 
      High-resolution mode enables transmission network analysis; national mode streamlines policy studies. Complete 8,760-hour 
      coverage with no missing data. All capacity factors physically constrained (0-100%). Seasonal patterns validated 
      (summer solar peaks, winter wind maxima). Mathematical consistency verified (annual normalization ±0.001 tolerance). 
      Hourly fractions feed time-slice design algorithms and renewable energy process definitions. Preserves natural 
      variability patterns for grid integration analysis, energy storage sizing, and system flexibility requirements 
      in energy system optimization models.

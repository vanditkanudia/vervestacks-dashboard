- **2000**: Co-created TIMES formulation - The mathematical foundation that would transform global energy modeling

### Phase 2: Artisanal Excellence Era (2000-2015)
- **15 years of handcrafted model building** - "Better and faster" with each iteration
- **2010**: FACETS development - Systematic data processing breakthrough
- **Philosophy**: Each model was a work of art, manually crafted with deep expertise
- **Tools**: "Loved SQL till I met you" - Systematic database-driven approaches

### Phase 3: Systematic Automation Begins (2015-2022)
- **2015**: IEMM (International Electricity Market Module) for EIA
  - First major automation after 20+ years of artisanal work
  - Sophisticated Python architecture with PyPSA, xlwings, advanced time slicing
  - 7+ years of development (2017-2024 based on source code)
  - REZoning integration, VEDA template structure, SQLite operations
- **2022**: KiNESYS platform launched
  - Extended IEMM approach to entire energy sector
  - 80+ SQL scripts processing global datasets (IEA, BP, WEO, EMBER, SSP, USGS, Rystad)
  - Comprehensive sectoral coverage (Steel, Buildings, Transport, Gas, Hydrogen, CCS)
  - Multiple regional aggregations for different clients
  - Still required "a few hours to build a full model"

### Phase 4: Democratic Revolution (2025)
- **July 8, 2025**: VerveStacks development begins
- **July 10, 2025 12:37 PM**: Initial git commit by akanudia@kanors.com
- **July 25, 2025**: Core architecture built in single day
  - `verve_stacks_processor.py`, `iso_processing_functions.py`
  - `existing_stock_processor.py`, `veda_model_creator.py`, `main.py`
- **August-September 2025**: Rapid iteration and enhancement
- **Today**: 100+ countries, 5-minute model generation

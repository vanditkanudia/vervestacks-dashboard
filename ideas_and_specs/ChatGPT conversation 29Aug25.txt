# VerveStacks Publication & Narrative Development — Project Map

## 1. Publication Strategy
- **Two-paper arc**
  - *Nature paper*: Structural physics of transitions  
    - Key point: Structural sensitivity >> parametric uncertainty.  
    - Conceptual breakthrough: “Resolution is destiny.”  
  - *VerveStacks paper*: Methods/data resource paper  
    - Offering: fully calibrated, high-resolution, open-use country models.  
    - Positioning: Turning point → OS moment for ESOMs.  
- **Journal targeting**
  - High tier: *Scientific Data* (Nature), *Nature Energy (Methods)*.  
  - Mid tier: *Environmental Modelling & Software*, *ESSD*, *Energy Strategy Reviews*.  
- **Requirements for top-tier**
  - Rigorous validation, reproducibility package, polished figures.

## 2. Title & Positioning
- Debate around including **“open-use”**, **“country”**, **“multi-region”**, **“high-resolution.”**  
- Final choice:  
  **“VerveStacks: An Open-Use Framework for High-Resolution Country Energy System Models.”**  
- Framing:  
  - “Open-use” = new paradigm.  
  - “Country” = concreteness.  
  - “High-resolution” = rigor.

## 3. Abstract & Introduction Drafts
- **Abstract evolution**
  - Initial draft framed pipeline as offering.  
  - Revised draft clarified: **the models are the offering**, pipeline is enabler.  
  - Strong points: OS moment, division of labor, superiority over artisanal models.  
- **Intro skeleton**
  - Problem: silos, complexity, exclusive guild of modelers.  
  - Gap: frameworks exist, but no open-use models.  
  - Contribution: VerveStacks models, builder/user separation.  
  - Importance: democratization, decision-grade use, structural turning point.

## 4. Validation & Methodology Development
- **Validation blueprint**
  - Base-year reconstruction (TWh, mix, capacity).  
  - Fleet vintages (aggregation diagnostics).  
  - Hourly load profiles (ERA5 vs observed).  
  - RE zoning (CF curves, land use constraints).  
  - Stress-slice adequacy (hourly vs TS emulator).  
  - Transmission clustering (NTC sanity, sensitivity).  
- **Metrics and targets**
  - Demand error ≤ 3–5%.  
  - Capacity/generation share divergence small (JSD, L1).  
  - Curtailment/ENS/cost differences within ~5–10%.  
- **Figures**
  - Pipeline schematic, coverage map, scatterplots, CF curves, adequacy plots, regional clustering.  
- **Methodology backbone**
  - Demand (EMBER, AR6/NGFS, ERA5).  
  - Supply (GEM, IRENA, EMBER, EPA CCS, NREL, EIA hydro).  
  - Model configuration (Voronoi clusters, OSM NTC).  
  - Timeslices (stress identification, hybrid sets).

## 5. Historical Narrative
- **Pre-VerveStacks blogs**
  - *Breaking silos*: technical, sectoral, geographical → collaboration is essential.  
  - *Democratization*: broaden access, empower non-coders, involve stakeholders.  
  - *Managing complexity*: modular design, intuitive tools, transparency.  
- **Core shift**
  - From *improving practice* → to *changing structure*.  
  - Division of labor: builders vs users.  
  - OS moment: models usable without building.  
- **Our Creation timeline**
  - 1990s: India MARKAL → Canada Multi-Region MARKAL.  
  - 2000s: SAGE (global MARKAL), EFDA TIMES (global TIMES).  
  - 2010s: JMRT (Japan), FACETS (US states), PET/EU TIMES.  
  - 2018–2020: AU-TIMES (Australia), IEMM (parameter-driven, automation begins).  
  - 2020s: KiNESYS (automation for full ESOMs), Veda Online (cloud usability).  
  - 2025: VerveStacks (open-use, high-resolution global country models).  
- **Epochs**
  - Artisanal era (pre-IEMM).  
  - Automated rigor (IEMM, KiNESYS).  
  - Open-use era (VerveStacks).  
- **Key insight**
  - Automation increased rigor and granularity — not simplification.

## 6. Website / Communication Assets
- **Appendix / About page content**
  - Historical narrative: from artisanal → automation → open-use.  
  - Positioning VS as culmination of decades of innovation.  
- **Visuals proposed**
  - Timeline diagram: 1990s → 2000s → 2010s → 2020s → VerveStacks.  
  - Three epochs: Artisanal → Automated Rigor → Open-Use.  
  - Flow diagram for silos → democratization → complexity → OS moment.

# The VerveStacks Journey: A Humble Story for the Website

## From One Model to 190 Countries: A 30-Year Evolution

### The Beginning (1994)
It started with a single question: *How can we help India plan its energy future?*

Building that first MARKAL model took months of careful work - every parameter hand-crafted, every assumption meticulously validated. It was artisanal energy modeling at its finest, but it could only serve one country at a time.

### The Foundation Years (1994-2000)
We kept asking: *What if we could make this better? Faster? More accessible?*

Those early years taught us that great energy models aren't just about mathematics - they're about understanding how countries actually work. We added stochastic programming to handle uncertainty. We co-created the TIMES framework that would become the global standard.

But each model still took months to build.

### The Craft Era (2000-2015)
For 15 years, we perfected the art of model building. Each project was a masterpiece - carefully constructed, deeply validated, uniquely tailored.

We built VEDA to make the complex simple. We developed FACETS to systematize our data processing. We fell in love with SQL and systematic approaches.

But we could only help a few countries at a time.

### The Automation Awakening (2015-2022)
After 20 years of artisanal work, we asked: *What if we could automate this?*

We built IEMM for the U.S. Energy Information Administration - our first major automation breakthrough. Then came KiNESYS, extending automation to entire energy sectors.

We could build models in hours instead of months. But it still required expert teams.

### The Democratic Moment (2025)
This summer, we asked the biggest question yet: *What if anyone, anywhere, could have a world-class energy model in minutes?*

Eight weeks later, VerveStacks was born.

## What We Learned Along the Way

### Every Country Deserves Great Models
We've seen too many important decisions made with outdated data or oversimplified assumptions. Every country - from the largest economies to the smallest island nations - deserves access to the same quality of analysis that took us decades to perfect.

### Automation Amplifies Expertise
We didn't automate to replace human insight - we automated to amplify it. VerveStacks captures 30 years of energy modeling wisdom and makes it instantly available to anyone who needs it.

### Speed Enables Better Decisions
When you can generate a model in 5 minutes instead of 5 months, you can explore more scenarios, test more assumptions, and make better-informed decisions. Speed isn't just convenient - it's transformative.

## The Humble Truth

We didn't set out to revolutionize energy modeling. We just kept asking: *How can we help more countries plan better energy futures?*

VerveStacks is our answer - not because we're the smartest people in the room, but because we've been in this room for 30 years, learning from every mistake, celebrating every breakthrough, and always asking: *What if we could do this better?*

## Where We're Going

Today, VerveStacks can generate energy models for 100+ countries in minutes. But we're not done asking questions:

- *What if every policy maker had real-time access to energy scenarios?*
- *What if every researcher could test their ideas instantly?*
- *What if every student could explore energy futures hands-on?*

The journey from one model to global automation took 30 years. The next chapter - making world-class energy analysis as common as spreadsheets - starts now.

*Because every country's energy future matters. And every decision maker deserves the best tools we can build.*

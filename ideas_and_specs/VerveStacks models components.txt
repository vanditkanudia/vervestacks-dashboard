VERVESTACKS MODEL COMPONENTS

*Demand
- electricity demand
-- base year generation/import/export from ember = base year demand
-- growth based on median values from AR6 scenarios for 5 climate categories (iso - R10) mapping
-- sector shares split from AR6 (to identify EV load)
- hydrogen demand
-- 0 in base year
-- future projected as share of total electricity demand in AR6 scenarios
- electricity demand profile
-- hourly profiles by ISO from era5_combined_data_2030 - broken into industry, residential, and commercial by assuming contributions to variations and allocating the hourly variation to each sector.

*Generation
- existing coal/gas/oil/hydro/nuclear/pumped hydro/solar/wind plants from GEM - flexible aggregation
-- missing capacity added from EMBER/IRENA
--- existing solar/wind units get appropriate utililzation profiles from Atlite
-- Eff and cost assumptions based on region/size/vintage of units
--- Eff calibration based on total emissions
- CCS retrofits for each unit based on EPA table 6 logic of costs and efficiency/capacity penalties
-- CO2 transport and storage modeled with a flat $30/t costs right now
- new conventional plants from WEO pg dataset. Costs for new solar/wind/hydro too.
- wind onshore/offshore/solar 
-- GW potential by 50X50 km grid from REZoning.
-- potentials reduced by about 40% for solar and 30% for wind based on most conservative landuse overlap.
-- Solar/wind profile for each grid_cell from Atlite
- New hydro potential from EIA
-- P10/P50/P90 monthly availability profiles from synthetic data based on historical numbers
- storage batteries from NREL
- Hydrogen electrolysers from NREL

*Model configuration
- Regions
-- create demand, generation (voronoi clusters population and GEM units) and renewable potential clusters. RE clusters based on capacity and distance from demand clusters.
-- Trade links from gen clusters to closest demand clusters and from RE clusters to closest demand/generation clusters.
-- estimate NTC across clusters with OSM data and compute distances for eff/cost of transmission lines.
- Existing power plants at unit level - aggregated below a threshold - 100MW by default.
- solar/wind potential aggregated into 15-30 cost-CF classes
- Time periods - 2022, 2025-30-35-40-45-50 by default, but flexible.
- Timeslices
-- identify stress periods
--- assume current demand profile
--- existing nuclear capacity (flat dispatch) hydro capacity (load followign within hours each month)
--- take a mix of solar and wind based on relative LCOEs (REZoning data) to meet the annual TWh.
--- distributing the wind/solar by hour leads to shortages and surpluses
--- compute "coverage" for each hour and rank days/weeks on scarcity/surplus/voltality
--- pick combinations of days and weeks from these lists to compose hybrid ts definitions.
--- ready scenarios for between 1 to 600 timeslices.

**Future plans - moving towards full ESOM
* More supply regions (currently we have existing generators and renewable supply)
- Coal supply regions
-- import/export terminals and mines
- Gas supply regions
-- LNG terminals and pipelines
* Demand regions with disaggregated and elec+non-elec consumption
- buildings regions (OSM data - cities by size)
-- buildings services
-- transportation services
- inter-building region transportation
- Industrial regions
-- steel regions (GEM)
-- cement regions
-- petchem regions
-- paper regions

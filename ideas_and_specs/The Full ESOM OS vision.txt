VerveStacks OS: The Operating System for Energy Transition
Vision Statement
VerveStacks OS is professional energy modeling infrastructure that provides authoritative, validated, and regularly updated energy system models for every major economy. Like Windows for computing or iOS for mobile, it's built by experts and used by everyone - maintaining the division of labor that enables professional excellence while democratizing access to sophisticated energy system analysis.

Core Philosophy: Open USE, Not Open SOURCE
The Fundamental Principle
Professional Creation ? Universal Access

NOT "everyone contributes" 
BUT "experts build, everyone benefits"

Division of labor is not a limitation - 
it's THE feature that ensures quality, consistency, and trust.
Why This Matters
* Open Source Fallacy: "Many contributors" ? Fragmentation, inconsistency, no accountability
* Professional Model: Expert teams ? Authoritative results, maintained quality, clear responsibility

# Why VerveStacks Models Are Closed-Source

VerveStacks provides **open-use models, not open-source code**. This deliberate choice serves both practical and philosophical purposes.

## The Product Philosophy

Just as you don't need McDonald's recipes to eat their food, you don't need VerveStacks' code to use our models. We deliver finished, validated, ready-to-run energy models—products, not projects. The value is in what you can do with them, not how they were made.

## Quality Assurance

Closed-source development ensures consistency and reliability across all models. Every VerveStacks model follows identical quality standards, validation procedures, and methodological approaches. This uniformity would be impossible with distributed, uncoordinated open development.

## Complementary Approach

The open-source ecosystem already offers numerous options for those who want to build models themselves (PyPSA, OSeMOSYS, Temoa). VerveStacks fills a different gap: serving those who need to USE models, not BUILD them. Adding another open pipeline would duplicate existing efforts while leaving the usability gap unaddressed.

## Sustainable Development

Without institutional funding, maintaining and improving the pipeline requires preserving future options for sustainability—whether through consulting services, custom implementations, or support contracts. The closed pipeline enables these possibilities while still delivering free models to all users.

## Future Flexibility

The architecture allows for open-sourcing if and when appropriate incentives or partnerships emerge. But premature open-sourcing without resources for maintenance would lead to fragmentation and quality degradation, ultimately serving no one.

**The bottom line**: VerveStacks prioritizes universal access to high-quality models over universal access to source code. This choice enables the division of labor that energy modeling desperately needs—letting builders build and users use.
